# first-unity-project
This is my first attempt at creating a game on Unity!
All the assets used were found on the Unity Asset store and were free. I followed multiple youtube tutorials to help me figure out how to code the game to do what I wanted it to do. There are some issues that I'm still running into:

-Sometimes my particle effects don't appear on collision usually when the background begins repeating... [FIXED]

-Still need to add audio

-Adding smoother movements between keydown events.
